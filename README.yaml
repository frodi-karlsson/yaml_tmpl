description:
  - "This project is a hopefully not useful go server that leverages yaml as a templating language."
  - "It's just a way for me to experiment with Go."
installation:
  - "You can install the package with `go get github.com/frodi-karlsson/yaml_tmpl`"
usage:
  - "Run the example server from /main with `go run main.go`"
  - "Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser"
  - "Alternatively, you can build the example site statically with `go run main.go -static`. You'll find the output in /main/docs"
  - "Probably actually don't use this for anything. It's just a toy."

templatingLogic:
  syntaxRules:
    - "Any non-indented key is an html tag"
    - "If its value is a string, that's the content of the tag. This is a short hand of children: raw: \"{{ . }}\""
    - "If its value is a map, the keys are attributes of the tag"
    - "An attribute with a key of 'children' is a list of child tags"
    - "An attribute with a key of 'innerText' will be the inner text of the tag. This is a short hand of children: raw: \"{{ .innerText }}\""
    - "Children of 'children' are html tags"
    - "'raw' as a child is parsed as a raw html string"
    - "For development simplicity, and lack of need, there is no difference between a sequence and a mapping"
    - aliases:
        - "You can use YAML aliases and anchors to repeat content"
        - "The value of an anchor is not transpiled until it's aliased"
        - "This allows you to separate definition from use"
        - "Overrides are also possible using \"<<: *anchor\" as expected"
    - "Because it's a transpiler, you can use Go templates in the yaml. For example, `pre: \"{{ .YAML }}\"`"
