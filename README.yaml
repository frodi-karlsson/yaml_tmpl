description:
  - "This project is a hopefully not useful go server that leverages yaml as a templating language."
  - "It's just a way for me to experiment with Go."
usage:
  - "Run the server from /main with `go run main.go`"
  - "Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser"
development:
  - "Uh... Don't"
  - "See more on why below"

templatingLogic:
  syntaxRules:
    - "Any non-indented key is an html tag"
    - "If its value is a string, that's the content of the tag"
    - "If its value is a map, the keys are attributes of the tag"
    - "An attribute with a key of 'children' is a list of child tags"
    - "An attribute with a key of content is the content of the tag"
    - "Children of 'children' are html tags"
    - "'raw' as a child is parsed as a raw html string"
    - "For development simplicity, and lack of need, there is no difference between a sequence and a mapping"
    - "No other yaml features are supported"
